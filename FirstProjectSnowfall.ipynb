The data will be shown in a separate graph for each year, with a single data point representing the total snowfall for each day in that week. Christmas day itself has a different looking data point to stand out, showing if it was a \"White Christmas\".

Even when it does snow, it has not been a significant amount. However, 1 out of the 2 years that data was available for did have a \"White Christmas\" where it snowed on Christmas day. Due to the limited data set, this 50% mark could be very skewed."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"QfMkDElDNn6N","colab_type":"text"},"source":[""]}]}
